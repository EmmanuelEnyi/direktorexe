This module contains functions to connect to and set up the SQLite database
for Direktor EXE â€“ Scrabble Tournament Manager.

Tables:
  - tournaments: Stores tournament details.
  - players: Stores player information associated with a tournament.
  - results: Stores match results submitted via the remote endpoint.
  
Note:
  - The players table includes extra fields: 'player_number' (which resets
    per tournament) and 'country' (for flag display).
  - Adjust the table schemas and field types as needed.
